# Daysheet
Daysheet is a Full CRUD front-end application that I built to help traveling musicians and
tour personnel. When a user logs in they have the ability to create a tour,
then they have the ability to create an itinerary for each day on the specified
tour. The user also has the ability to create and track personnel members for
correlating tours.
